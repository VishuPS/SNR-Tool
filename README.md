# SNR Tool

This tool can be used in both Matlab and Octave and the function provides a direct calculation of the Signal-to-Noise Ratio and BER value for a of a BPSK modulated bit stream. 

## SNR Calculation
SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) is a ratio based value that evaluates your signal based on the noise being seen. SNR is comprised of 2 values and is measured as a positive value between 0db and 120db and the closer it is to 120db the better: signal value and noise value typically these are expressed in decibels (db).

## BPSK Modulation

Binary Phase-shift keying (BPSK) is a digital modulation scheme that conveys data by changing, or modulating, two different phases of a reference signal (the carrier wave). The constellation points chosen are usually positioned with uniform angular spacing around a circle.

## Additive white gaussian noise
AWGN is often used as a channel model in which the only impairment to communication is a linear addition of wideband or white noise with a constant spectral density (expressed as watts per hertz of bandwidth) and a Gaussian distribution of amplitude.

## BER
In telecommunication transmission, the bit error rate (BER) is the percentage of bits that have errors relative to the total number of bits received in a transmission, usually expressed as ten to a negative power.

## Prerequisites
MATLAB/Octave

## How to use SNR Tool
Download and initialize to use the function.

## Examples on where SNR Tool can be used
This function can be used to easily obtain the values related to SNR in any BPSK transmission channel, and can be used in simulations and other research purposes where the SNR value is of importance.
